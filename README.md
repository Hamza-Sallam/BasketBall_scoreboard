# Basketball Scoreboard

This project is a basketball scoreboard application I created during my study for the [frontend developer path course on Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j) designed to track and display scores for basketball games. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing team scores, game time, and other relevant statistics.
